- YAML is ubiquitous everywhere, a significant part of a lot of jobs consists of editing YAML, etc.
- That's not nice, it's prone to indentation and whitespace typos, not ideal for structural editing, etc.
- I'd rather use (lisp's (syntax)) for YAML-y tasks.
- The goal is to have a small single-binary program that transpiles =.laml= into =.yaml=
